# GoF Design Patterns in C#

This repository contains abstract C# implementations of the 23 design patterns described in *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* by the Gang of Four (GoF).

## Patterns Covered
The patterns are organized into three categories:

- **Creational**
- **Structural**
- **Behavioral**

Each pattern is implemented in its own folder with minimal, abstract code to demonstrate the core idea.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a clean and minimal reference for each GoF pattern using modern C# syntax and principles.

## Usage

Clone the repository and explore the pattern folders. Each folder contains:

- Abstract interfaces or base classes
- Minimal example implementations
